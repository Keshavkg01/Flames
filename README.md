## FLAMES Relationship Calculator
### Overview
This simple Python (or any language) program takes two names as input and plays the classic FLAMES game. It calculates and displays the relationship between the two names based on the letters they share. The relationships are derived from the word "FLAMES":

F - Friends\n
L - Love
A - Affection
M - Marriage
E - Enemies
S - Siblings
The game works by counting the number of characters that are not common between the two names and using this count to determine the relationship.

### How it Works
The program takes two names as input from the user.
It compares the characters in both names, removing common letters.
The remaining letters are counted, and this count is used to calculate the corresponding FLAMES relationship.
The final relationship is printed to the console.
